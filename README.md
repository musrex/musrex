- 👋 Hi, I’m @musrex
- 👀 I’m interested in learning front end web dev and building web apps. I also want to learn rust for fun and peek into the deeper depths of programming.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning JavaScript and Rust. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything JavaScript related! I'd like to learn vanilla JS first and then move onto other frameworks or libraries.
- 📫 You can reach me via email at leandro.n.lopez@gmail.com
