Hi! 👋  
I’m Leandro Lopez. I craft code 💻 with an artist's touch 🖌️  
I have experience with:  
  - Python 🐍  
  - HTML 🏗️  
  - CSS 🕶️  
  - JavaScript ✨  
  - Java ☕  

But really, I'm always trying to learn new things 🤓  
  
I also enjoy the Flask Micro Framework, nerding out and working on my NeoVim config, or taking my dog Fly out for a walk. 🐕
