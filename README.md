Hi! 👋  
I’m Leandro Lopez. I craft code 💻 with an artist's touch 🖌️  
I'm always trying to learn new things 🤓  
  
I also enjoy the Flask Micro Framework, nerding out and working on my NeoVim config, or taking my dog Fly out for a walk. 🐕

*My baby arrived before I was able to finish it! Still, was super valuable and I totally recommend it.  
**Have to go back and finish it. Really good but got caught up with language specific books.  
***More of a reference, so kinda hard to power through. Definitely recommend just reading the NGINX docs.  
****Great - book of essays. I Don't read it all the way through but come back occassionally.
